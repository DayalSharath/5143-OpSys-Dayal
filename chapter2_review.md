## Question 1. What are three objectives of an OS design?
An operating system is a software that runs on the computer. It manages the computer's memory, processes, and all of its software and hardware i.e., it acts as an interface between applications and the computer hardware.  
The three objectives of OS are:
 • Convenience: An OS makes a computer more convenient to use by using standard library programs or utilities. 
 • Efficiency: An OS allows the computer system resources to be used in an efficient manner. Super computers and mainframe computers mainly focus on efficiency than convenience.
 • Ability to evolve: An existing OS should be constructed in such a way that it should support the new system functions without interfering with service.
